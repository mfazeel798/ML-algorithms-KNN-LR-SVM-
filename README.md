# ML-algorithms
## KNN, LR, SVM, Multi Layer Perceptron Classifier

This Repositry is composed of Python Machine learning Exercises that i have practiced<br/>
The ML algorithms are implemented through sicket-learn framework using sklearn liberary.<br/>
Different other basic liberaries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and datasets have also been used<br/>

Algorithms Implemented are:<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; K Nearest Neighbor, Linear regression and Support Vector Machine, and Multi Layer Perceptron Classifier
