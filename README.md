# ML-algorithms
* #### Multi Layer Perceptron Classifier
* #### Spam Classifier by Logistic Regression
* #### KNN
* #### LR
* #### SVM

This Repositry is composed of Python Machine learning Exercises that i have practiced<br/>
The ML algorithms are implemented through sicket-learn framework using sklearn liberary.<br/>
Different other basic liberaries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and datasets have also been used<br/>

Algorithms Implemented are:<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; K Nearest Neighbor, Linear regression and Support Vector Machine, Multi Layer Perceptron Classifier, and Spam Classifier by Logistic Regression
